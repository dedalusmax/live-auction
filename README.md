# Live Auction
An WebRTC Proof-of-concept project in Angular 4 CLI

## Concept specification

The research job is about WebRTC. In a future project we’ll need audio. What do we need to achieve? Well, we need a sort of a “switchboard” for people talking to each other in the context of an auction platform. 

The typical setup for WebRTC for two people to talk to each other is in the below diagram, where you have some sort of signaling via the web server and audio streams directly.
